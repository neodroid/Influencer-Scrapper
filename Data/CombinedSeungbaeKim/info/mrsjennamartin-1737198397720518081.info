And I NEVER suggested there was anything cute about mental illness. And it's not a joke, I'm very aware of that myself. I also never said that you said it's a joke. When I say \"some people\", I don't mean you or me or probably anyone under this post. I mean hundreds and thousands of millenial kids who still think mental illness is trendy (which, I repeat, is NOT my opinion). Literally the only issue I have is that I see so many kids taking it the wrong way and therefore also spreading it the wrong way. The people behind this campaign are very strong and I believe in their good intentions. I just don't see that the intentions are actually getting them where they want to get. I have read the post saying that they are not a millenial company. That doesn't keep all those kids from chiming in and buying the necklaces as fashion accessoiries. I want mental health to be treated seriously and I'm not here to \"bully\" anyone.
