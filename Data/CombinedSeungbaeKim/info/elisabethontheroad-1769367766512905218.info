The majority of big game trophy hunters are white. FACT. A very large percentage of them are American, and many of them knowingly participate in hunting that is neither sustainable or ethical, and they\u2019re a huge part of the problem, as they are supporting the canned hunt industry. Making this observation is NOT racist. If a certain group is part of a problem...that should be noted. I have no issue labeling that as such, much like I don\u2019t have an issue stating that the Asian demand for rhino horn is an equally massive problem. Does that make me racist towards Asians? Hardly. And if you\u2019d prefer me to say Caucasian instead of white, you\u2019re just being nit picky.", "created_at": 1525226073, "did_report_as_spam": false, "edge_liked_by": {"count": 3}, "owner": {"username": "elisabethontheroad", "profile_pic_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8385c0fa1642a05ff131597868868085/5DED3C66/t51.2885-19/s150x150/49715074_613128842448826_1212616052463108096_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com", "is_verified": false, "id": "213646532"}, "viewer_has_liked": false, "id": "17941633171039684"}}]}, "id": "17881698859221231"}}, {"node": {"text": "Majestic!!", "created_at": 1525220785, "did_report_as_spam": false, "edge_liked_by": {"count": 1}, "owner": {"username": "katie_fritsch", "profile_pic_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5598633bd0a713480965a50bb754a935/5DD60B11/t51.2885-19/s150x150/50732939_2338909933004664_5656111177348939776_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com", "is_verified": false, "id": "232318769"}, "viewer_has_liked": false, "edge_threaded_comments": {"count": 0, "page_info": {"end_cursor": null, "has_next_page": false}, "edges": []}, "id": "17916073279130512"}}, {"node": {"text": "I used to be completely against any kind of trophy hunting, but when you put it that way, where the lion was inevitably going to die a more painful death anyway and it is going to benefit conservation, I can completely get behind it.

Say they were to attack an older male. They\u2019d take his females and territory, and push him out of the area he once called home. Without his pride and familiarity with resources, and with wounds sustained from the scuffle, he\u2019s not doing so well. It\u2019s not out of the question that he\u2019s emotionally distressed, and due to his age, his teeth aren\u2019t in good shape. He has 6 months to live; and he\u2019ll either die from starvation \u2014 or when the same trio returns to finish him off. Let\u2019s say the lions are all within the boundaries of a large park, and that park can sell a permit to a skilled hunter to shoot the older lion. He won\u2019t be baited, nor will he be \u201ctrapped\u201d in an enclosure without a means to escape. He will be hunted by foot and taken out with one, maybe two shots. ALL the money from the hunt will go to a security/anti-poaching unit for the park, or to a big cat conservation org. So, I\u2019ll ask my question now. If THIS is trophy hunting, how do YOU feel about it? If it\u2019s done on a case by case basis, sanctioned by rangers and biologists and done in an ethical manner, is it so bad? Unfortunately, this is NOT how most trophy hunting is conducted, which is why so many people, myself included, think it should be banned. Thousands of lions are bred in captivity each year just for hunting, and they\u2019re baited, drugged, trapped and generally shot at close range by rich, white tourists who aren\u2019t always skilled with a gun. That kind of hunting is well, quite frankly, not hunting. But it\u2019s the definition many of us have come to know, because that\u2019s how \u201chunting\u201d in many African countries is nowadays. It\u2019s been commercialized and tailored to the interest of humans \u2014 not animals. It\u2019s hard for me to get on board with any sort of trophy hunting, but I CAN see the benefit in allowing strictly regulated, sustainable trophy hunting. And it\u2019s only after seeing an older male, which these three brothers practically tore to shreds, that I can see why we should all have a more open mind about these things.
