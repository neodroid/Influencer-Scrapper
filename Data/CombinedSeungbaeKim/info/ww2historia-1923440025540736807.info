But, Mignano is just as or even more important of a battle than Cassino was for multiple reasons.\nIn the autumn of 1943 the German Bernhardt Line ran through the Mignano Gap and there the XIV Panzer Korps held up the advancing US 5th Army, of which a third was made up of British troops, while defensive positions were prepared at Cassino. So to speak, the Bernhardt Line was mainly existing at that point in time as a way to buy the Germans time as their more heavily defended Winter Line was bolstered defense-wise. \nHad the Allies broken through before the fortifications were complete, the Road to Rome would have been open. In the event, however, it took eight divisions two months to advance seven miles at a cost of 16,000 battle casualties and 50,000 non-battle casualties caused by the appalling weather, inferior equipment and the strain of mountain fighting. The 5th Army had exhausted itself. \nOn 13 November the Germans actually thought that they had lost the battle but on that same day the American Commander, General Mark Clark, called off the attack. By the time it was resumed the defences of Cassino were complete.\nSo this today, November 29th, is the day in which the allies launched their attack north of the gap, having already taken it. They would hit the Winter Line soon an the Battle of Monte Cassino would begin (January 17th-May 19th of 1944). The defenses along the Winter Line and especially Monte Cassino would be so firm that the allies even attempted to flank it with a landing at Anzio, which, due to command issues, Allos bogged down at the beachhead. If properly led, the allies could have completely encircled the Germans fighting along the Winter Line, but instead, once the troops at Anzio broke out, they went straight for Rome, allowing Kesselrings troops to retreat to the Gothic Line in the North. This picture shows an American soldier during the conflict.\n\u2014\n#ww"}}]}, "edge_media_preview_like": {"edges": [], "count": 4139}, "viewer_has_saved": false, "viewer_can_reshare": true, "edge_media_to_tagged_user": {"edges": []}}
