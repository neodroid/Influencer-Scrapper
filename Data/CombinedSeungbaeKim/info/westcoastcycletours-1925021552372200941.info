Total darkness and a misty rain. Still, had to.\n\nThis is the German Military Cemetery at Glencree in Wicklow. Buried here are some of the fallen German soldiers of World War 1 and 2.\n\nAmong them is the body of Nazi spy Hermann G\u00f6rtz. His story is interesting to say the least... G\u00f6rtz parachuted into Ireland early in the Second World War to transmit messages to leaders of the Third Reich in Berlin about a possible Irish invasion.\n\nIn full military uniform, this spy walked through Meath and on into Dublin on the morning after his landing. He even stopped into a Garda station to ask for directions.\n\nHe was sheltered by leading Irish politicians, republicans and Irish sympathizers to the Nazi cause. Or, simply, those who wanted the Nazis to put paid to British rule in Norther Ireland. Look up Plan Kathleen. Frightening.\n\nHe became a bit of a man about town, conducting affairs with numerous Irish women and was seen as something of a celebrity in some republican or nationalist circles.\n\nHe was eventually arrested and imprisoned for the duration of the war. After the Russians and Western Allies crushed the Nazis and Germany finally surrendered, G\u00f6rtz was set to be sent to Europe for trial. Fearing the Russian gulags, he committed suicide in '47 biting into his army issue cyanide pill.\n\nHe was laid to rest in Ireland, his coffin draped disgracefully and shamefully in a Nazi Swastika flag sewn by the members of Irish republican forces and/or sympathisers. I wonder if it's still down there.\n\n#TheWestAwaits\n\n#wildatlanticway #wanderireland #igersireland #irishpassion #ireland #loveireland #discoverireland #instaireland #wanderlust #photooftheday #picoftheday #love #summer #sun #ireland_gram #clare #burren #cliffsofmoher #coast #tour"}}]}, "display_resources": [{"config_height": 426, "src": "https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/65452272b3486fc720e0d460109c5f32/5DAEE49B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/44804686_582967248829176_8147719228858898628_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com", "config_width": 640}, {"config_height": 500, "src": "https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/4bcfe2526da76a8f1966347bcf668727/5DAB029B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s750x750/44804686_582967248829176_8147719228858898628_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com", "config_width": 750}, {"config_height": 720, "src": "https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/7d3bcfe1512dbf90c9f2a90da7242792/5DCB337E/t51.2885-15/e35/44804686_582967248829176_8147719228858898628_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com", "config_width": 1080}], "viewer_in_photo_of_you": false, "edge_web_media_to_related_media": {"edges": []}, "edge_media_to_tagged_user": {"edges": []}, "__typename": "GraphImage", "viewer_has_saved": false, "dimensions": {"width": 1080, "height": 720}, "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: night, tree, plant, outdoor and nature", "location": {"slug": "glencree-wicklow-ireland", "address_json": "{\"street_address\": \"\", \"zip_code\": \"\", \"city_name\": \"Glencree, Wicklow, Ireland\", \"region_name\": \"\", \"country_code\": \"IE\", \"exact_city_match\": true, \"exact_region_match\": false, \"exact_country_match\": false}", "has_public_page": true, "id": "264194477", "name": "Glencree, Wicklow, Ireland"}, "should_log_client_event": false, "owner": {"is_unpublished": false, "full_name": "West Coast Cycle Tours", "is_verified": false, "blocked_by_viewer": false, "username": "westcoastcycletours", "requested_by_viewer": false, "is_private": false, "profile_pic_url": "https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/344ef06b555a34a8df99ebb0c1a6d7ff/5DB80E1C/t51.2885-19/s150x150/21227016_114041309283842_2908597482583752704_a.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com", "followed_by_viewer": false, "has_blocked_viewer": false, "id": "1326666831"}, "edge_media_to_sponsor_user": {"edges": []}, "viewer_has_saved_to_collection": false, "id": "1925021552372200941", "viewer_can_reshare": true, "taken_at_timestamp": 1543700473, "tracking_token": "eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjo1LCJwYXlsb2FkIjp7ImlzX2FuYWx5dGljc190cmFja2VkIjp0cnVlLCJ1dWlkIjoiMzg1N2IzNTNiZTNjNGRmNDgyZWRhZjkwNjEyYmJlZGMxOTI1MDIxNTUyMzcyMjAwOTQxIn0sInNpZ25hdHVyZSI6IiJ9", "viewer_has_liked": false, "is_ad": false, "gating_info": null}
