But everyone (including the bullys) knew that I was holding in my feelings of depression. Well, it wasnt until last year, when I was in grade seven, when the bullying, got worse. They already started the rumors in grade six but then, it didn't really bother me bc all my friends knew that they were fake. But last year in grade seven, it did get worse for me. Well, I live in Brockville,Ontario,Canada. And there was this wierd rule in Brockville that came across about five years ago, that all public schools would only teach up to grade six and if you were in grade 7,8, you would be taught on the high schools. But of course you would still have grad. And that you wouldn't be called a high school student bc of course you aren't in grade nine yet. So of course that means there is new ppl, new bullys. And as you can probably guess, there was new bullys. Well, one Thursday night,my nanny was put in emergency at the hospital. Because she got a 104 fever. The reason why she was taken there, was bc she has stage 4 lung cancer. And she can't get sick. And if she does, if we don't take her into the hospital, she can die.
