This is a photo of me, taken by my bestie @sashafoto. In the last 365 days I have gained many thoughtful followers, and I wanted to take the time to introduce myself and get to know you. Here\u2019s a quick introduction: I live in Brooklyn. I am a photographer and a writer. My work often takes me on the road and I travel an average of 35 - 40% of the year for National Geographic, airline, tourism, & travel companies. While home in the city I mostly take portraits and tell people-driven stories for magazines & brands. My birthday is on halloween. When I was growing up the family dog was the biggest member of our family ( I am 5\u2019 4\u201d). I organize a pickup ultimate frisbee group in Prospect Park that you should definitely join if interested. I also do karaoke almost every Wednesday. I am LGBT and every time I mention that I lose a couple hundred followers (byeeeeeeeeee!). My favorite food is peanut butter but I recently found out I am allergic to peanuts and now I can no longer have my favorite food but my acne is gone and my stomach no longer hurts every day so I guess we can call it even? My boyfriend is a farmer. In New York City. I know that doesn\u2019t make sense. I am a proud Ravenclaw and unabashed Scorpio. I was born in Georgia but grew up in south Florida and have now lived in NYC for eleven years so I know all the secrets. Spotify tells me my most listened to album of 2018 was the Waitress soundtrack which proves I am more of a broadway nerd than I can even believe. I need to run to stay sane. Labyrinth is one of my favorite movies and I have a Ludo figurine that watches over my bedroom. I wrote a children\u2019s book last year and it was really well reviewed and I am very happy with it! The issues I care most about are climate change and LGBT Rights. If I were a dog I would be a corgi. If I was a Pok\u00e9mon I would be Pichu (with a flower in his ear). I once did a job photographing a fancy whisky distillery and now I am a whisky snob and I have no regrets!!! This example is proof that work can change you and that\u2019s probably fine.
