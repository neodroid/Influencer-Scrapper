Thank you to all my friends and family for following me on this journey, I'm so thankful for the support as I start this again. I'm also really looking forward to the future.... To be honest Tuesdays = #tbhtuesdays\n\nI wanted to lay some truths so I thought why not make up a hash tag haha \ud83d\ude02 anywhos I wanted to post a before photo that I felt extremely uncomfortable about. Here it is. I see a beautiful boy in my arms but that person I feel is not me. My friend wanted to take a photo of us and I cringed thinking of what I must've looked like and low & behold the exact picture in my mind. Aaaand that's what needs to change - my son will never see me as that person.  He will be thankful when I attend his school activities, take him to the movies and kiss his boo boos. He's not gonna care that my hair is 100 percent of the time in a bun, I have dark circles under my eyes and lavalavas show every inch of my tummy \"pooch\" I call it. So I need to also stop that thinking. I don't want to get fitter and slimmer and have those thoughts that I'm not good enough. So today I'm taking the new challenge of loving myself by positive affirmation. It sounds so silly but positive affirmation works wonders. You know why at primary school when a teacher would come up behind you and look at your scribbles you've spent 20 minutes on and say \"Your doing a good job at that handwriting there Perry\" because positive affirmation encourages you. (PLUS teachers could never pronounce my name right but that's off topic \ud83d\ude02) I read a book when I was younger called \"The Secret\" and I really enjoyed the part on positive affirmation. It's when you speak out loud to the universe and pretty much command what you want. I think that's why I've always been so into gypsy/hippie things like energy/auras and vibes - you can't fake them. So I'm gonna try it, I've done this before and didn't really stick to it. So I will write 3 things I like about myself and read them out loud each morning, also 3 things I'd like to improve on in a positive way. I'll keep you updated and see how it makes me feel \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udcaa#positiveaffirmation"}}]}, "tracking_token": "eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjo1LCJwYXlsb2FkIjp7ImlzX2FuYWx5dGljc190cmFja2VkIjp0cnVlLCJ1dWlkIjoiNDhmMWJkYzE0MmVhNGUzOGE3NzM0MGE5ZmJkYTlkMzgxNDE5MTYxNjM0ODk5NzMzMTk5In0sInNpZ25hdHVyZSI6IiJ9", "has_ranked_comments": false, "display_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ae1e3fbce43665faa1b4fb20a8ef630d/5DE467D8/t51.2885-15/e35/15624832_371174086590641_8096498813113466880_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com", "edge_web_media_to_related_media": {"edges": []}, "edge_media_preview_comment": {"count": 10, "edges": [{"node": {"text": "Keep up the good work \ud83d\udc4d We can't wait to see more!", "created_at": 1484599544, "did_report_as_spam": false, "edge_liked_by": {"count": 1}, "owner": {"username": "baliandbeyond", "profile_pic_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b0310d6e0289132a1c2edb9edb4106ad/5DDBF3F8/t51.2885-19/s150x150/67276005_447416235812871_2380181746281873408_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com", "is_verified": false, "id": "175953103"}, "viewer_has_liked": false, "id": "17847212464177684"}}, {"node": {"text": "@baliandbeyond aww thank you! \u2764", "created_at": 1484638220, "did_report_as_spam": false, "edge_liked_by": {"count": 0}, "owner": {"username": "fitmama__perry", "profile_pic_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1a39563026edb206c0710d63878ef01b/5DDC04B1/t51.2885-19/s150x150/66624204_491928704892364_5015248833551007744_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com", "is_verified": false, "id": "3531305629"}, "viewer_has_liked": false, "id": "17872535101020507"}}]}, "comments_disabled": false, "edge_media_to_sponsor_user": {"edges": []}, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: 5 people", "is_video": false}
