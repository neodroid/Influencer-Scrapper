I don't think this case ruined Luke's personality because all he felt at that moment was fear. He saw what Palpatine did to the Jedi Order, what the Empire did to the galaxy, and how many innocent people Vader killed - and when he saw darkness in Ben's eyes, he was scared that all of this tragedy could happen again. He wanted to build a new order and Luke was trying to keep everything under control to keep them safe. Even though he was (one of the) greatest Jedi, you can't blame him for that. He suffered a lot by the dark side, and so did his friends, but it was still a huge mistake. You know, because \"fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering\"... and when Luke activated his ligthsaber at that moment, it wasn't because he has changed - it was because fear directed him. His thoughts weren't clear and he forgot that it's always very dangerous to sense/see the future. That's why Anakin turned to the dark side, and that's why Ben did. I don't doubt that there were some darkness in him, but I bet Luke could have prevented this with some trust. Ben was a child; probably he was confused, probably Snoke tried to manipulate him, and probably he had some issues with his parents, and after all his master betrayed him; at least he felt like he did. Ben Solo actually needed someone in his life who he can trust in, who he can share his thoughts with but Luke wasn't the right person as he probably sensed his doubts, and he felt more and more diffidence. Tbh I feel deeply sorry for both of them, because both Luke and Ben were victims of their fears.\n-\n-\n#daisyridley #daisysarmy #rey #kyloren #adamdriver #bensolo #savebensolo #lukeandrey #lukeskywalker #ahchto #markhamill #starwarsforever #starwarsnerd #starwarsfan #starwars #thelastjedi #theforceawakens"}}]}, "tracking_token": "eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjo1LCJwYXlsb2FkIjp7ImlzX2FuYWx5dGljc190cmFja2VkIjp0cnVlLCJ1dWlkIjoiN2Q2Mzk4YjAxZWYyNGZjNGFmZmU3ODkzNGE3OWUxZmIxNzI1MDM3NTc1NTg2MjM4MTQ2In0sInNpZ25hdHVyZSI6IiJ9", "has_ranked_comments": false, "display_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/730cf5293dc2755195203af7db5f264f/5DACE81A/t51.2885-15/e35/28154473_227926487755600_110060899192012800_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com", "edge_web_media_to_related_media": {"edges": []}, "edge_media_preview_comment": {"count": 32, "edges": [{"node": {"text": "@daisyridley_dailynews yeah i know!", "created_at": 1521091335, "did_report_as_spam": false, "edge_liked_by": {"count": 0}, "owner": {"username": "naylapoetrikresna", "profile_pic_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7ead8b67c5cb9e5508ff8ae60e6da816/5DBCA6DC/t51.2885-19/s150x150/64348537_861197910926105_2775230677799403520_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com", "is_verified": false, "id": "3979347260"}, "viewer_has_liked": false, "id": "17902588300153036"}}, {"node": {"text": "I absolutely agree to this,except the Ben solo part", "created_at": 1525305736, "did_report_as_spam": false, "edge_liked_by": {"count": 0}, "owner": {"username": "maxvonmarkgraf", "profile_pic_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/dba2a1f693be88b06dd0cf26c62e4aaa/5DADD51B/t51.2885-19/s150x150/50692754_374616453360774_1735086939847000064_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com", "is_verified": false, "id": "5632768383"}, "viewer_has_liked": false, "id": "17926496122123049"}}]}, "comments_disabled": false, "edge_media_to_sponsor_user": {"edges": []}, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: 1 person, text", "is_video": false}
