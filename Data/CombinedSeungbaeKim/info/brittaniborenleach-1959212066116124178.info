Like I said move on, keep scrolling or better yet don't follow someone you don't like or believe in. This world has gotten so bad about thinking they can comment whatever they want because they are on social media and not face to face with someone. I feel most people would not say such mean and nasty things to others if they were face to face with them but feel they can write whatever they feel and be as rude and mean as they want. I think all of you vloggers should block more people if it was me I probably wouldn't have many followers because I would just block them. I feel you are putting your life out there for us to enjoy not to judge or make rude,mean,nasty comments. Keep being you Brittani! I love you and your family and your channel. Block all the mean ass people out there! You can just have a Block Party!", "created_at": 1547942788, "did_report_as_spam": false, "edge_liked_by": {"count": 0}, "owner": {"username": "mimi_to_four", "profile_pic_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c27315e938aac7a7257ec60f1a17b86a/5DF4041A/t51.2885-19/s150x150/11875590_1094732273887898_1842307118_a.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com", "is_verified": false, "id": "1939931877"}, "viewer_has_liked": false, "edge_threaded_comments": {"count": 0, "page_info": {"end_cursor": null, "has_next_page": false}, "edges": []}, "id": "17916680098273091"}}, {"node": {"text": "Right!
