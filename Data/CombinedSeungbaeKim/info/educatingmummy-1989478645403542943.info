We have learnt over the years some movies that my nieces watch are not suitable for Milo despite them being the same age. I wouldn't say we wrap him up in cotton wool, quite the opposite in terms of knowing world news and so on. But when it comes to characters in movies, we know that Milo dislikes scary faces, or jump moments in films. When I say dislikes, things linger with him and usually at bed time or when the house is dark things surface and he wants us upstairs when he goes to sleep. Not in his bedroom but upstairs. We reassure him as every parent does but this does not always alleviate all of his fears. So when the Momo meme/news came around. We wanted to educate Milo that if anything ever, popped up onto the screen that he should always tell us even if the computer said otherwise. We never told him the name of the meme just incase he googled it and we most certainty did not show him a picture. Yesterday, Milo greeted Miles after school when he told M that his teacher had showed him a picture of Momo to reassure the class that its not scary and actually its all fake news. Last night we had a very upset boy, who couldn't sleep and wanted a night lamp on after months of not having one. Of course I emailed the teacher, and he has apologised and explained that all he wanted to do was qualify to the children that it was fine and not real. However, the damage has been done already and I am not sure how long the image will last for Milo.
