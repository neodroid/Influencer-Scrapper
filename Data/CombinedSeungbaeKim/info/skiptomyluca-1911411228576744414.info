My triggers for my anxiety have always been the same: illness (specifically throwing up), mass shootings, travel, and terrorist attacks. I vividly remember my mom talking me down from my anxiety. \u201cMass shootings are so rare. The only people who are killed by guns are people who are already in big trouble like being involved in gangs and drugs.\u201d \u201cTerrorist attacks only happen in the Middle East. We are safe in America.\u201d \u201cYou are so young and healthy. You don\u2019t need to worry about getting sick.\u201d \u201cAirplanes are totally safe and you can travel without worrying about a thing.\u201d She always assured me that my worries were real things but that I was safe and sound.\n\u2022\nOver the past two months or so, my anxiety has become unbearable. Mass shootings in America are commonplace. Terrorist attacks have become the norm and are often domestic. I had nightly, intense panic attacks when we traveled to Disneyland. Poppy had a stomach bug which truly sent me over the edge and I sit here tonight, convinced that I have it too (I\u2019ll do this nightly for at least another week).\n\u2022\nMy irrational fears have become rational and there\u2019s no good way for anyone to talk me out of it. I work hard to control my anxiety, but I\u2019m not always successful. I share a lot of things here, but I don\u2019t always share this because it is intensely personal, and I\u2019ll read it tomorrow and the silliness of my fears will be clear. I want you all to know that whatever you struggle with, you\u2019re not alone. Tell a friend, talk it out, start a journal, but don\u2019t suffer in silence.
