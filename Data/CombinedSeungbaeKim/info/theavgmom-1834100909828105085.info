Few days back I read a post by @themigratorymum and that made me write this. I have been sitting on this for a while now. As I keep saying, what you see on my grid is only the best moments captured in a certain way. Life is made up of much more. Instagram is a hobby, not my life. So Instagram knows very less about me. I don\u2019t talk about my emotions easily; yes I may come across as an extrovert but I am actually not. I hide my feelings. But I am cesspool of them, most of us are. .\n\nBut writing has always been cathartic. Reading her post made me feel that I need to write more from the heart, share the pain too with my Instagram. It may not be nice to read for all. But will help me deal with it. It is after all my page \ud83e\udd23. .\n.\n\nYou guys remember our recent Europe trip? U Saw stories; ooh and Ahhed with me when I shared the beauty that is the Alps, the dream that is Paris, the colour that is Italy. Today I am gonna tell you something black. I hid this till now, coz I was not ready to share. As I said, I hide the dark bits, because I am scared to share the raw parts of my heart. .\nHere goes, We were visiting the Fourvi\u00e8re Basillica at Lyon. An expensive and massive  building perched on the top of Fourvi\u00e8re hill. It overlooks the beautiful city; which is also known as the gastronomical capital of the world. And it was this hillside view we were enjoying in the afternoon when we felt hungry. It was lunch time, baby A had run around inside the Basillica and was now sleeping cozily in his pram. .\n.\nMe and Tall A were free, and we were in France, on top of a beautiful hillside. It doesn\u2019t get better, does it? Yes it does. We noticed a small restaurant, with an open sitting area outside, overlooking the beautiful city, with delicate lace covered round tables, gold rimmed crockery glistening in the sun, placed aesthetically on them. Wine and water both clinking in elegant flute glasses. And people relaxing and having a languid, lazy lunch. Picture perfect. A lazy lunch on a sunny day in a picture postcard place in France. Tired parents us, yearning for some romantic moments in our life. rest \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb... #theavgmom #theavgmomwrites"}}]}, "edge_web_media_to_related_media": {"edges": []}, "dimensions": {"height": 1350, "width": 1080}, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: 5 people, sky, shoes and outdoor", "edge_media_to_comment": {"count": 66, "edges": [{"node": {"owner": {"username": "theavgmom", "profile_pic_url": "https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/4cf6d312c9538ad303f0e9d56a82da14/5DAFD07A/t51.2885-19/s150x150/22221088_471809919869612_562608469161541632_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com", "is_verified": false, "id": "660420143"}, "viewer_has_liked": false, "created_at": 1532937551, "edge_liked_by": {"count": 0}, "text": "@rattlebabblebattle exactly , wish we have a better world someday.
