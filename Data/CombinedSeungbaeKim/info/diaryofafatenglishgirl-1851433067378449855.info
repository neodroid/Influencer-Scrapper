I was only 23 at the time and it still takes my breath away to this day. Most days I can get by without thinking about her too much, I can get on with my life in most respects, but like you said, there are many times when I realise I will never see her again and it's like she's died then and there all over again. I know I will never see her again deep down, and I know she's not around on a daily basis but I feel like sometimes I just pretend she's on holiday and I'll see her dancing in the kitchen again, or she'll send me a text telling me she loves me, or I'll get a Facebook post from her that will make me cringe, but every now and then I'll have the realisation that this will never ever happen again and it's like someone's knocked the wind out of me. I don't think it's something you can explain to other people who haven't experienced loss like this because they just expect you to know your mum's not there anymore, so explaining to them that sometimes you get upset because you realise you'll never see her again is hard to explain. Anyway, I just wanted to say that your posts really mean a lot to me as I feel like you understand what it's like to have your mum die at such a young age.

Firstly how utterly shit it is, a year and a half later I still get stopped in my tracks and feel suffocated when I realise I will never see her again. I know she\u2019s gone but the daunting realisation that I have to navigate the rest of my life without her to lean on crushes me. Secondly that having a friend that truly understands how you feel brings me comfort. I don\u2019t want to be part of this club. The Motherless Club. I would never wish this pain on anyone, but having someone that understands every ounce of pain, grief, guilt and sadness you feel makes you feel less alone. That we can share moments and memories of our mum and not feel the other person is thinking *oh no, she\u2019s talking about her dead mum again, is she going to start crying*. (Not to say I don\u2019t appreciate my friends who haven\u2019t lost their mum because I do.) I\u2019m not going to feel guilty for bringing my mum up, she was a person (a bloody amazing one at that) and deserves to be spoken about, sometimes I see the uncomfortable look on people\u2019s faces when I\u2019ve tarnished a really happy fun moment with the mention of my mum. It shouldn\u2019t be this way. Death is so final, but I refuse to accept that. She lives on through me, through my son, my sister, my brother, my niece and nephews, through those that loved her, knew her, shared a memory or even just a moment with her. What would I say to someone who\u2019s friends with someone going through grief? Don\u2019t ever be afraid to talk. I love it when people ask me about my mum, or when I\u2019m talking with family and cousins and a funny anecdote of my mum comes up. I\u2019m learning new stories that no one mentioned before she died. Just because they aren\u2019t here anymore doesn\u2019t mean they should become taboo. So let\u2019s talk.\n.\n.\nI\u2019ll start with a memory of my own. My mum once snored herself awake while we were all sitting around watching television. She assumed we\u2019d made the noise and woken her. And wouldn\u2019t believe us when we said it was her. She then sulked, she was so annoyed and that memory really makes me laugh \ud83e\udd23.
