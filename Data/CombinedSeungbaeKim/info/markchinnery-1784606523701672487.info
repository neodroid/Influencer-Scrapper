For the most part, Nezu was able to dodge the bullet albeit by a narrow margin by maintaining a safe distance, slipping in and retreating where necessary and landing the odd low kick. Toward the end of each round, Nezu was able to instigate a takedown but on both occasions, the bell sounded before he could press home with any advantage. R3, and could Fullswing land one of his roundhouse rights? He certainly showed endeavor but none of his shots were clean hits and conversely, toward the middle of the round, Nezu shot for a successful takedown, taking Fullswing's back & attempting a choke. Fullswing shook it off and when they resumed to the stand, Fullswing continued to throw his windmill punches but time run out before he could score anything significant. Nezu was deemed the victor by split decision (28-30/30-28/30-29 \u2605Yosuke Saruta (\u733f\u7530\u6d0b\u7950) vs. Itchaku Murata (\u6751\u7530\u4e00\u7740)\n\nThis fight for the World Strawweight title was one way traffic with Saruta dictating from the outset. He grabbed Murata's leg on a low kick and completed a takedown. From there, he worked on his positioning, slipping in the occasional heavy shot. Saruta worked it to a half mount and back position as Murata valiantly tried to escape, all the while being peppered with ground and pound, Saruta content to whittle away at his foe. Murata bearly makes it past R1. R2, and once again Saruta catches Murata's leg on the follow through, forcing a takedown and slipping the occasional heavy blow from his dominant position, but it wasn't enough as the ref broke them up just past the midway point. But there would be no hurrah for Murata, as Saruta unleashes a left hook for the last action of the round. R3, and yet again, Saruta grabs Murata's kicking leg but rather than taking him to the canvas, he throws a right hook that floors Murata. Saruta swarms all over him, raining down with hammer fists, prompting the ref to step in.\n\n#\u4fee\u6597\u4f1d\u627f #\u683c\u95d8\u6280 #\u7dcf\u5408\u683c\u95d8\u6280 #\u4fee\u6597 #shooto #\u30dc\u30af\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0 #\u30ad\u30c3\u30af\u30dc\u30af\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0 #martialarts #\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0 #\u67d4\u8853 #jiujitsu #grappling #ufcfightpass #UFC"}}]}, "tracking_token": "eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjo1LCJwYXlsb2FkIjp7ImlzX2FuYWx5dGljc190cmFja2VkIjpmYWxzZSwidXVpZCI6IjNhMTRlZjljMWNkNDRmNGZiOTJkZmJiYmU5MTE2OGNjMTc4NDYwNjUyMzcwMTY3MjQ4NyJ9LCJzaWduYXR1cmUiOiIifQ==", "has_ranked_comments": false, "display_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/80710d767f9915dc9d952ce041804ff9/5DCC8440/t51.2885-15/e35/32187088_192651518027812_6301675878975799296_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com", "edge_web_media_to_related_media": {"edges": []}, "edge_media_preview_comment": {"count": 0, "edges": []}, "comments_disabled": false, "edge_media_to_sponsor_user": {"edges": []}, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: 3 people", "is_video": false}
