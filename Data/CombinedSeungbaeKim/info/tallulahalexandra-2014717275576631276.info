I am sure you have done your own research and are making the best decision for you and your body, the only reason I'm saying anything here is that Instagram is what first brought the app to my attention. There have been some really well researched articles written about the problems with #NaturalCycles that are much better than anything I'm going to be able to write here. The reason I stopped using the app were after multiple health professionals warned me that the app was making false claims about its effectiveness. It was also tracking and notifying me about changes in my cycle which should have disqualified me from using it safely, while explicitly reassuring me that it was still safe for me to use. While I was lucky and didn't get pregnant, many other women have. Any app that markets itself as a 'different kind of birth control' while stating in its terms and conditions that it is not a form of birth control (unless they have changed this since I stopped being a user) is in my opinion something to treat with extreme caution.
